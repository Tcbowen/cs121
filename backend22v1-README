The app allows you to register accounts on the server and receive a unique USER_ID token.

You can send messages using Volley and POST/GET Requests.
The app sends Strings over HTTP which can be in the form of JSON text, and I believe it can be modified to use JSONObjects more directly.

This version uses POST requests for all data transfer but GET can be used if URLs are constructed manually (see BackendTest1-v4 for GET)

In the backend, it queries the User Class database, filters using POST parameters, and returns a dictionary the User Class variables
Currently the user class only keeps track of user_name (first name) and user_content (JSON text)
The way these pairs and objects are stored can be modified for whatever component and other database Classes can be created for them.
